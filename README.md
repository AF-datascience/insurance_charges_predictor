# Prediction of Insurance Charges 

This project is designed to be a quick look into how a regression based linear model could be used to predict an insurance charge given detailed information around insurance customers. 

The data contains detailed information on the following: 
- Age 
- Sex 
- BMI (Body Mass Index) 
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status 
- Region (USA) 

Having access to this data will allow a data scientist to get a better veiw into customer behaviour along with the factors that contribute to insurance charges. 

By understanding the patterns in the data, an insurer for example could create great value in setting up an insurance plan with specific charges for specifically identified people. This could yield more profit by correctly prediciting what their insurance charge is rather than say a random guess. But could also help in understanding demographics more easily in our data. 

This quick project will benefit from being broken down in the following way: 

# Problem Framing

We want to build a machine learning model able of predicting the insurance charge for an individual.

Our solution wil be used to see if we build a better model than a random guess

We would say that performance can be measured when we have an average error of less than say 30% 

If our model on average predicts values with an error of above 30% this would mean that we are charging 30% more than we should be! 

# Type of Problem 

Supervised learning problem - we have the labels 
Regression problem - we are trying to predict a number 

# Data sources

A singular csv file with a few thousand rows and the above features
